            <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I am currently a student at Iowa State University. Currently I work for a company called Selegic to help develope apps. I have not done many <em>projects</em> but I have learned a few languages. I will list the languages I do know and briefly describe what I did with them.</p>

                <h3>Skript</h3>
                <p>Skript is a minecraft plugin developed as a scripting language to give developers the ability to access the api programatically compared to command blocks or data packs. Some things I have made using Skript is a sword that summon lightning when struck against a target. Another thing I made was a scoreboard which kept track of kills and the players. I also played around with particles to make some items like the sword more flashy when used.</p>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Java is something I learned by myself, but since I took Com S 227 (Object Oriented Programming) the language really stuck with me and is now my preferred language. The first project I probably attempted by my self was snake, although I am pretty sure I did not follow the tutorial I was doing properly and it did not compile. Although since Com S 228 (Intro to Data Structures) I remember making sorting algorithms and racing them to compile fastest. Another project was to develope a sort of civilization simulation game.</p>

                <h3>Html</h3>
                <p>Html is something I admittedly do not have a lot of experience with but I did spend some time learning it prior to Com S 319 (Construction of UI). I was following a tutorial online, although most of it is hazy. It did teach me a lot of the process though and some things you can do. I am pretty sure I was able to make a sort of filter on photos and give it a sort of green screen effect though I am pretty sure that was more Java Script than Html or Css. Another thing I have made was a website with access to an api library of cats using <a href="https://thecatapi.com">the cat api</a> to sort them by weight and breed.</p>
